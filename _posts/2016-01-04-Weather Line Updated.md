My favorite weather app on iOS, [Weather Line](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-line-forecast-graphs/id715319015?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4), just received a free update that includes a new Today Widget, a new font, better location search, and more. 

At $2.99, Weather Line is a no-brainer. I've been using it for years, and it's the only iOS weather app that's stuck.
