title: "Panic Suspends Sale of Transmit for iOS"

[Cabel Sasser](https://panic.com/blog/the-future-of-transmit-ios/):

> Transmit iOS made about $35k in revenue in the last year, representing a minuscule fraction of our overall 2017 app revenue. That’s not enough to cover even a half-time developer working on the app. And the app needs full-time work — we’d love to be adding all of the new protocols we added in Transmit 5, as well as some dream features, but the low revenue would render that effort a guaranteed money-loser. Also, paid upgrades are still a matter of great debate and discomfort in the iOS universe, so the normally logical idea of a paid “Transmit 2 for iOS” would be unlikely to help. Finally, the new Files app in iOS 10 overlaps a lot of file-management functionality Transmit provides, and feels like a more natural place for that functionality. It all leads to one hecka murky situation.

[Panic](https://panic.com) is my favorite company in the world, and I'm sad to see that they couldn't make Transmit on iOS work financially. I use the Mac version often. I hope that Apple will continue to make iOS more power user-friendly, and that it's enough to coax Transmit back into the App Store. It's all upside with developers as good as Panic on their platform.
